## Cross-Project Sync

Favorites are stored globally, not per-project. This means:

- Add a favorite in Project A
- Open Project B
- The same favorites are available

## Storage Location

Favorites are stored in:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/GodotAssetPlus/` |
| Linux | `~/.config/GodotAssetPlus/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/GodotAssetPlus/` |

## Offline Access

Favorite metadata is cached locally, so you can see your favorites even without internet. However, installing requires an active connection.
